Team 7  Curriculum mapping tool

This project will develop a tool to visualise the courses in the Computer Science curriculum, 
identifying their connections, level, and degrees they are being taught in. The aim of the 
tool is to provide an easy way for students and lecturers to visualise our degree offering, 
identify pathways and gaps.
