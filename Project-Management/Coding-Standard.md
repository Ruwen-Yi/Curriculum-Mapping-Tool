### Folders-by-Feature Structure
###### [Style [Y152](#style-y152)]

  - Create folders named for the feature they represent. When a folder grows to contain more than 7 files, start to consider creating a folder for them. Your threshold may be different, so adjust as needed.

    *Why?*: A developer can locate the code, identify what each file represents at a glance, the structure is flat as can be, and there is no repetitive nor redundant names.

    *Why?*: The LIFT guidelines are all covered.

    *Why?*: Helps reduce the app from becoming cluttered through organizing the content and keeping them aligned with the LIFT guidelines.

    *Why?*: When there are a lot of files (10+) locating them is easier with a consistent folder structures and more difficult in flat structures.

      ![Sample App Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/master/a1/assets/modularity-2.png)

      Note: Do not structure your app using folders-by-type. This requires moving to multiple folders when working on a feature and gets unwieldy quickly as the app grows to 5, 10 or 25+ views and controllers (and other features), which makes it more difficult than folder-by-feature to locate files.

    ```javascript
    /*
    * avoid
    * Alternative folders-by-type.
    * I recommend "folders-by-feature", instead.
    */
    app/
        app.module.js
        app.config.js
        app.routes.js
        directives.js
        controllers/
            attendees.js
            session-detail.js
            sessions.js
            shell.js
            speakers.js
            speaker-detail.js
            topnav.js
        directives/
            calendar.directive.js
            calendar.directive.html
            user-profile.directive.js
            user-profile.directive.html
        services/
            dataservice.js
            localstorage.js
            logger.js
            spinner.js
        views/
            attendees.html
            session-detail.html
            sessions.html

    ```
