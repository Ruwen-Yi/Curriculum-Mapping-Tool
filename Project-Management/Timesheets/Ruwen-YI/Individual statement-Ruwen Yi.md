### Contributions:

1. Design web applications architecture, and drafted the milestone plans to provide a clear direction for the team about our project.
  
2. Established the skeleton of the web application by using Node.js and Express framework. With this framework, I created a server, basic routes and controllers.
  
3. Set up APIs to provide a gateway for data transmission between the client-side and the server-side.
  
4. On the server-side, implemented multiple functions to receive and parse client requests.
  
5. On the client-side, created functions to request or parse the data return from the server. Through these functions, a user can view different data on different web pages.
  
6. Collected all the user input from the "add course" form, "edit course" form, "add new course" form and "add new degree" form. And sent these form data to the server-side and updated the database.
  
7. Populated degree structure page with the degree data return from the server.
  
8. Populated course relationship page, "add course" form and "edit course" form with course data.
  
9. Populated course overview page with the course data.
  
10. Filled in the "add course" form with the course searching results so that a user can search a course and add it to a degree.
